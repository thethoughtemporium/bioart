## Making Art With Opentrons

I recently recieved an opentrons OT2 and wanted to test it's capabilities, so as a fun starting project I decided to make some petri art.

This repo contains all the succesful files I made for printing some simple patterns on a standard 100mm petri dish.

To calibrate the dish and make it so that all the droplets end up on the dish properly, there is a bit of a trick to it. During calibration, move the pipette tip to the lowest spot on the agar (this will be dependant on the slant of the dish and the 3d printed receptical), and then slowly lower the tip until it touches the agar and makes a tiny divit. Then raise the tip up 1mm, and then lower it 0.3-0.4mm back down. This sets the tip at exactly the right height and works 80% of the time to get a good print.
